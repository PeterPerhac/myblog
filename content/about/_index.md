Hi, I'm Gerald Benischke and I'm a software engineering consultant.  

Through my company Software Design Systems Ltd, 
I've worked with [Equal Experts](https://www.equalexperts.com/), HMRC, MoneySuperMarket, Barclays, MBNA and others 
spanning over 20 years of engineering in the public, financial and telecoms sectors. 

My primary interests are around middle-tier services, databases, security, 
automation and functional programming.
